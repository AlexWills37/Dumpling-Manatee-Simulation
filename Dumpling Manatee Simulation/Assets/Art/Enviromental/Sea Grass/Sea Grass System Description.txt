Sea Grass System Description:

The sea grass system uses skinned meshes and shapekeys to make grass sway back and forth


This technique was chosen over several other available methods for the following reasons:
	1) Shader-based grass movement (usign a displacement shader to bend individual grass blades) was discarded since the unity shadergraph is only 
		accessible through URP which at this popint was not functioning on the oculus headset. Perhaps someone with more developed technical skills 
		could implement a version of this using the built-in render pipeline
	2) Animated grass movement (usign bones to create a swaying motion which would allow for better individual bending of grass blades) was discarded
		as testing found it to be about half as effecient as shape-key based grass movement and we needed a large quantity of seagrass even with a 
		minimal rig


The grass meshes were set up as follows:
	1) A texture is painted using photoshop (or equivilent software)
		a) the alpha channel should make everything other than the individual blade of grass transparent
	2) A mesh is created using Blender (or equivilent software).
		a) Each blade of grass was made by having a plane follow a curve (curve modifier in Blender)
		b) The blade is duplicated and rotated 90 degrees such that the top-down veiw of the grass forms a cross. 
		c) Each of these blades is then duplicated and its normals are flipped since the built-in RP lacks facilities for double-sided rendering
		d) The blade is then duplicated and curved/rotated into new positions to form a clump of grass
		e) The Shape keys are created using a lattice to deform the model
			1) A lattice modifier is assigned to a collection of grass blades
			2) The lattice is asigned a defaul shape key, then positioned to bend the grass blades along each axis, with each being given its own 
				shape key in the lattice
			3) Each lattice shape key is applied as a shape key to the grass mesh (modifiers>lattice>apply as shape key). The shape keys should 
				come in the following order (if they are not setup in the corrct order they will animate incorrectly): 
				0: X deformation
				1: -x deformation
				2: Y deformation
				3: -Y deformation
				4: stretch upwards on the Z axis
		f) The mesh is then exported as an FBX and imported to unity where it should appear as a skinned mesh. Dragging it into the scene and 
			selecting it should show a "blend shapes" tab in the skinned mesh renderer which can be tested by hand
	3) A material is created using the standard template with the texture created above dragged into albedo and emission.
		a) The Rendering mode should be set to cutout and adjusted so that only the grass blade itself appears when rendered
	4) The sea grass mesh is given the tag "SeaGrass" and a GrassWave script is attached to an object in the scene 
		(Only one of these objects is required)
